This Python program uses Tkinter to build a window application for the PokeMMO breeding calculator I built.

Feel free to copy the code and use it for yourself.
NOTE:If you do so and want to include the Pikachu icon in your window, you have to specify your path where your Pikachu icon is in. Alternatively delete that line to remove the icon.

Icons were chosen from https://www.flaticon.com and created by "Roundicons Freebies"
